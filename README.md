Simple Angular HTTP Example
-----------------------------

To use the app simply click on the index.html file located in the 'app' folder.

Dependancies can be seen in the package.json file. The task runner was used to automate css compilation. The original sass file is 'styles.sass' and can be found in the sass folder. The gruntfile.js file has also been included.

If you wish to install the dependancies ensure NodeJS, Ruby and Sass are installed. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root folder and run npm install to install the dependancies. Once installed you can run 'grunt sass' in the command prompt to run a one off sass compilation task or 'grunt watch' to continuously watch the file and have it comile every time it is saved. Installing these dependancies is not required for the project to run and is provided as background as to how the app was built.
